# Hi, I'm Junaid 👋

Senior Software Engineer specializing in **backend systems, full-stack web applications, and scalable cloud infrastructure**.  
I build **production-grade software** — systems that run long-term, handle real users, and don’t fall apart in production.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- Design and build **scalable backend systems** using Node.js & TypeScript
- Develop **full-stack web applications** with Next.js
- Architect **multi-tenant platforms** (RBAC, permissions, tenant isolation)
- Design clean, maintainable **database schemas**
- Refactor legacy JavaScript systems into **modern, maintainable codebases**
- Deploy, monitor, and optimize applications on **Linux servers**

- React
- Server-side rendering & API routes

### Databases
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- MySQL / SQL Server
- Indexing, bulk operations, data consistency

### Cloud & DevOps
- Azure Virtual Machines
- PM2 (cluster mode, log rotation, monitoring)
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Nginx
- Secure deployments & server hardening

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🔹 Cashless Vending Platform (Full-Stack System)
**Problem:** Legacy systems were unreliable, hard to scale, and poorly structured  
**Solution:** Designed a modern backend with clean APIs, proper data modeling, and server-side business logic  
**Impact:** Running in production, handling real users and transactions

**Tech:** Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Next.js, Azure VM

---

### 🔹 Smart Locker Management System
**Problem:** No centralized platform for managing inventory, users, and access  
**Solution:** Built a multi-tenant backend with role-based access and real-time state management  
**Impact:** Enabled scalable locker operations across multiple tenants

**Tech:** Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, Azure

---

### 🔹 IGI Vitality Drive – Data Processing Platform
**Problem:** High-volume data ingestion was inconsistent and error-prone  
**Solution:** Implemented structured ingestion, batching, validation, and lifecycle tracking  
**Impact:** Reliable processing of large datasets with improved data integrity

**Tech:** Node.js, MongoDB, SQL

---

### 🔹 Transformer Monitoring System (ELECTREE)
**Problem:** No centralized backend for monitoring and historical analysis  
**Solution:** Built backend services for data ingestion, storage, and reporting  
**Impact:** Enabled long-term monitoring and analytics

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles I Follow

- Clean architecture over quick hacks
- Type safety and validation at boundaries
- Clear separation of concerns
- Production logging and monitoring
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom

---

## 📫 Open to Opportunities

- Freelance backend / full-stack work
- Long-term remote roles
- System redesigns and refactors
